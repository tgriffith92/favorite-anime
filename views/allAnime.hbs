    {{!-- Synopsis from deathnote.fandom.com --}}
    <p>One of my favorite anime is Death Note. Death Note (デスノート, Desu Nōto) is a manga series created by writer Tsugumi
        Ohba and illustrator Takeshi Obata. The series centers around a high school student who discovers a supernatural
        notebook that allows him to kill anyone by writing the victim's name while picturing their face. The plot
        follows his attempt to create and lead a world cleansed of evil using the book, and the complex conflict between
        himself and those assailing him that results.</p>
